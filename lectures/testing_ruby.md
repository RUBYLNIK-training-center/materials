## Testing Ruby code

Testing is a fundamental part of the working process. In production systems, you literally can't survive without writing tests.
We'll use [RSpec](https://rspec.info "RSpec") throughout the course.

#### Why testing is important?

Not only it makes you sleep better at night, but also a good-written tests act like a **documentation** for the code you write! 
In any new app, tests folder is a nice entry point to start the acknowledgment with a project.

#### Testing levels

In different articles, you can find a different explanations for testing levels. Usually it's called a "testing pyramid".
You can divide the tests types into 3 parts: unit, integration, system. 

- Unit tests are intended to test the smalles pieces of your codebase in isolation. (e.g. a method of a class).
- Integration tests are intended to test how components work together (e.g. interaction between 2 classes).
- System tests are intended to tests the system as a whole, usually using such instruments as Selenium or Cypress.

On this step, try to focus on unit tests only.
Here's the example of Factorial calculator and a unit test for it.

```ruby
class Factorial
  def factorial_of(n)
    (1..n).inject(:*)
  end
end
```

```ruby
describe Factorial do
  subject(:calculator) { Factorial.new }
  it "finds the factorial of 5" do  
    expect(subject.factorial_of(5)).to eq(120)
  end
end
```

‚úèÔ∏è On your own, try to implement a Fibonacci calculator and a corresponding spec file for it.

Please, take your time to carefully read the following materials and do not forget to write your own tests!
