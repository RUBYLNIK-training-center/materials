# Introduction

Welcome to the Ruby & Ruby on Rails course.

The first part of the course is self-passed. 
Step-by-step, you're required to go through the learning materials and submit the homeworks within the provided deadline.

Each lecture contains the links to articles / videos to watch, as well as homeworks to submit. 
Many of the homeworks are self-passed, some of the you'd be required to submit and pass the CI checks.
